### Voice commands that don't need a syntax

Onyx comes bundled with [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing). This means that you don't have to fill out forms to make Onyx understand what you want.

### Onyx understands you.

With state of the art [AI tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), Onyx can almost read your emotions. She can tell if you're happy and console you when you're sad.

### A good listener, a great learner.

Onyx harnesses the power of [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning). The more you use Onyx, the better she gets at understanding you.

### Onyx is omnipresent.

From an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marv) to a [Facebook Messenger chatbot](https://www.facebook.com/onyxai), Onyx strives to venture onto new platforms.

### A genius in the brewing.

Given enough time and data, Onyx is capable of evolving into a real-life replica of Jarvis from [Iron Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/).

### Don't miss out on the opportunity.

The **first one thousand people** can get a sneak peek at Onyx's [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marv) by becoming a beta tester on Google Play.
